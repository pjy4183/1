  <h2>Shadowing</h2>
  <img src="englishlearning.jpg" width="450">
  <p><strong>English shadowing</strong> (sometimes called “echoing”) involves repeating a piece of
  English audio word-for-word as you listen. You might already have done this
  in class when you repeat a new phrase along with your teacher. You may also
  shadow when you sing along to your favorite English songs.</p><p> Shadowing is a
  great method for beginner learners to improve English speaking. That’s
  because it gets you in the habit of speaking English out loud right from
  the start.</p><p> While you may not understand everything you’re saying, you’ll be
  mimicking correct English pronunciation, which will set you up for success in
  spoken English. It’ll also get you more comfortable and confident so you
  improve English speaking in general.</p>
